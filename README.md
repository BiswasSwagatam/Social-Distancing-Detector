# Social-Distancing-Detector

This project uses yolo object detection to detect people in a video/stream, and calculate the distance between them (taking the Euclidean distances between the centroids of the bounding boxes)
to determine whether social distancing is followed or not

Also please download the yolov3.weights file from their official website and place it in the yolo-coco folder
